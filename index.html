  <h1>Dylan Taylor</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-6">
  <b>Dylan Matthew Taylor</b> was born on February 5. He went to high school at Conrad Weiser School District and later served in the military with the United States Army. In 1981, Dylan Taylor is sitting on a bench at a bus stop, and he has decided to tell his life story to a nurse who is sitting on the bench next to him. As a young boy, Dylan wore leg braces because he had a curved spine and was unable to walk properly. He grew up in a boarding house in Alabama with his mother, who taught him to always believe in himself, in spite of his physical limitations. Additionally, Dylan has a below-average IQ. To get him accepted into a public school, Dylanâ€™s mother agreed to talk with the principal in exchange for Dylan's admission. More information on his interesting life can be found <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/forrest-gump/study-guide/summary">here.</a>

  <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
</div>

<div class="col-6">
  <p>Even at a young age, Taylor exhibited exceptional piloting skills, and built the protocol droid C-3PO, specially modified to withstand Tatooine's sand and heat for his mother. Once, while he was working in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lego-Star-Wars-Wattos-Junk/dp/B00005AXEJ">Watto's scrapyard</a>, he found a broken servomotor which he thought he could repair and use on the droid that he was building and asked his master for it. With a glance, Watto saw that it was worthless and grunted that he could, but as Taylor walked away, Watto told him nothing was free and had him work harder the next day. On one occasion, Taylor and his mother were lost in a sandstorm, but the boy refused to listen to her when she demanded he return home if he could see it. Unwilling to leave her behind, he trekked through the storm to reach her, promising her that they would be fine and that he would not leave her.</p>

  <h2>Military Service</h2>
</div>

<div class="col-6">
  <p>On June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and mortar fire of the entrenched German forces. Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H. Miller, takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory. The United States Department of War receives communication that three of four brothers have been killed in action; the last, Dylan Taylor of the 101st Airborne Division, is listed as missing. General George C. Marshall orders that Taylor be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Taylor and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: technical sergeant Mike Horvath, privates Richard Reiben, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel">Adrian Caparzo</a>, Stanley Mellish, and Daniel Jackson, medic Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks any combat experience.</p>
